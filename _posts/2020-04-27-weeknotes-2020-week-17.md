Not much this week to even warrant a set of weenotes, just hard at work trying to finish [the last 90%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule) of my ongoing client project.

Things I've briefly looked into, on the margins of work:

- Automating backups with [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) and
  [Borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/). [Alex
  Schroeder](https://alexschroeder.ch) has a [good
  post](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-12-24_Borg_Backup) on the former.
- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/), a Web browser with Vim-like keyboard
  bindings and minimalist UI.
- Making visual work with Blender 3D, with [inspiration from
  Stephen](https://merveilles.town/@stephen/104050390719683477).
- "[It's time to Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)", by
  Marc Andreessen. You don't have to like Andreessen or his line of work
  (venture capital) to agree with much of the sentiment. It is indeed time to
  build. The hard, era-defining question is _what_ to build.

See you next week!
