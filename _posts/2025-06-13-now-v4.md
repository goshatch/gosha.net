## Waiting for our family to grow

My partner and I are expecting our second child to be born any day now :) To say I’m thrilled is an understatement.

## Looking for work

My contract got caught in a round of layoffs, so I am now hunting for a new job. I’ve put together a [Hire Gosha!](https://hire.gosha.net) website for job hunting purposes, check it out, spread the word, and please [let me know](mailto:mail@gosha.net) if you (or anyone you know) need a senior full-stack engineer who can ship fast.

## Making progress on Parts

Together with my partner, an [Internal Family Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) therapist, we’re building [Parts](https://parts.ifs.tools), a parts mapping tool for IFS therapists and their clients. We have made a lot of progress on Parts, and we are going to be asking the people who have signed up to the waiting list to start testing it soon.

I’m excited to see if this project will fly!

## Exploring programming languages

In addition to getting comfortable with Clojure and ClojureScript, I’ve been poking at some other programming languages recently, mostly of the functional and strongly typed variety. The most fun of those has been [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I’ve written a little [Scheme interpreter](https://github.com/goshatch/ploy) in it, which has been a really enjoyable experience. I’d like to get a chance to use Haskell more!

## Studying computer science and math

I’ve been very slowly making my way through the legendary computer science textbook, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) (2nd ed.), by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. Although my progress is slow, it is also immensely satisfying, and I hope that brushing up on comp-sci fundamentals (and math — I’ve been going through fundamental courses on Khan Academy) will in the future allow me to tackle harder, more interesting problems in computing.
