Hello from locked down London, in the spring of COVID-19, 2020. I hope that
you're all healthy and limiting social content while waiting for things to
improve out there. With everything that's going on, it's been a challenge to
stick to any kind of normal routine, especially to someone as
organisationally-challenged as I am.

During the lockdown, I've decided to dedicate a couple of hours every day to
long-neglected personal projects, and the first thing I've done was to finish
preparing two projects that have been on the backburner for a while.

## Dissertation

The first project is the dissertation that I wrote for my MA Photography degree
at the Royal College of Art in 2018. It talks briefly about the post-war history
of photography in Japan and in China, and explores the work of two
photographers, Nagashima Yurie and Luo Yang, and the connections between their
two styles.

It's called [Luo Yang × Nagashima Yurie: Contemporary East Asian photography and
the portraiture of the common ground](/projects/portraiture-common-ground).
Check it out!

## Returnees 海归

politics, but now, having been abroad, I understand that China has a specific
path it needs to follow.”" %}

[The second project](/projects/returnees) is a weird one. In the summer of 2018,
I was in Beijing, interviewing and photographing Chinese citizens who had just
returned home after a long time abroad. I took many photos, and recorded over 20
hours of interviews, but after I came back, the project got stuck: I didn't have
enough material to produce something meaningful -- the story was just not told
the way it deserved to.

This eventually led to a collaboration with a writer friend, [Hengtee
Lim](https://twitter.com/hent03), who graciously wrote a short story to match
the photographs and the interviews. The story is called “Different Worlds”, and
it's included in this project alongside the photographs.

(Hengtee has a collection of short stories, “[Something Like
Hope](https://www.snippetsbooks.com/)” that would make for a fantastic read in
these complicated times. You should get a copy!)

The other thing that's included alongside the photographs is quotes taken from
the interviews. The quotes are included under pictures, but out of context:
those things were not necessarily said by the person in the picture.

I hope you enjoy these two projects. Please stay safe out there, and wash your hands :)
