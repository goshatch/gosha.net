It's been another intense workweek. Here are a couple of things that caught my
attention throughout:

- Robin Sloan's ongoing game development notes in newsletter form, [Perils of
  the Overworld](https://www.robinsloan.com/overworld/) have been a fascinating
  read, not just if you're interested in games, but also in writing, technology
  (the last issue has some machine learning in it!), and so on. Recommended.
- I recently discovered [Tom MacWright's blog](https://macwright.org) through
  his piece on [organising his music
  library](https://macwright.org/2020/01/27/my-music-library.html), which
  resonated strongly with me (my own setup is similar). There are gems of
  insight and writing throughout, but I especially recommend his [book
  reviews](https://macwright.org/reading/) section, which quite closely mirrors
  something I'm planning to build for my own website in the near future.
- Speaking of amazing websites, I've been studying [Andy Matuschak's
  Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) as I'm building my own knowledge
  management system based on the zettelkasten principle. The amazingness of the
  clarity with which the notes are written is matched only by the wonderfulness
  of the web app itself. Take a look!

I think that the weeknotes format will evolve a bit over time, as I find myself
not really writing so much about what I've been doing, but rather about
interesting things I came across. See you next week!
