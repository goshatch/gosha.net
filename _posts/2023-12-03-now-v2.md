Updated the [Now page](/now), archiving the contents below for posterity (stealing this idea from [Piper Haywood](https://piperhaywood.com/tag/now/)).

## Improving this website’s accessibility

I've been learning about accessibility and working to improve it on this website and making some slow progress. I’m posting updates on [this Mastodon thread](https://merveilles.town/@gosha/111078441324258664).

## Drawing

I love drawing but have largely abandoned it after starting university, for lack of time. I’m trying to pick it up again, with a first goal of filling up a small notebook. I’m also posting updates on Mastodon, [in this thread](https://merveilles.town/@gosha/111479225488078347).

## Reading

Reading a lot of works by Ursula K. Le Guin recently. In particular:

- The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction
- The Left Hand of Darkness
- Space Crone

The Left Hand of Darkness blew me away, and I much prefer it to The Dispossessed, which I had read last year. The essays have given me a lot to think about, and I have also very much enjoyed the style.
