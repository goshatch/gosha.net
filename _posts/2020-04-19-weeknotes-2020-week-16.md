Another week of lockdown. I've spent most of it on doing my best to wrap up a
client project that's due at the end of the month, but I did have time for a
couple of interesting bits and pieces.

### Taming emails with mu4e

There comes a time in each Emacs user's life where they want to do pretty much
_all the things_ in Emacs, and one of the first _all the things_ is email.

I've experimented with an Emacs-based email client called
[Wanderlust](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WanderLust), but it didn't end up
sticking with men (and neither did Emacs, back then). Now that I've more or less
[organised my around org-mode](/blog/2020/weeknotes-2020-week-15/), I wanted to
give this another go, this time using
[mu4e](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/mu4e).

I will probably write a blog post later about my exact setup, but for now I'll
say that I'm using [mbsync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html) to fetch
email via IMAP, and [msmtp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msmtp) to send email.
Please take a look at [this blog
post](http://cachestocaches.com/2017/3/complete-guide-email-emacs-using-mu-and-/)
for a great introduction to mu4e, and my own config files are
[available](https://github.com/gueorgui/dotfiles) if you want to take a look.

The killer feature of reading email in Emacs is that messages can be linked to
your org-mode agenda as todo items. It's the end of using the inbox as a todo
list, and I'm loving it.

### Pair programming

My friend [Marion](https://twitter.com/oiorain) and I have recently started
weekly pair programming sessions to go through the [Rebuilding
Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/) book by Noah Gibbs, and building a
Rails-like Ruby web framework from scratch.

This is a fun and educational exercise, and I'm enjoying the deep learning that
comes with it. We're only at the beginning, and I was already able to use
something I learned from the book in my daily work.

Until next week!
