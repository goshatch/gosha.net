## Building a little startup

Together with my partner, an [Internal Family Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) therapist, we’re building [Parts](https://parts.ifs.tools), a parts mapping tool for IFS therapists and their clients. This is my first foray into software for mental health professionals, which is something I hope to do more of down the line.

I’m excited and hopeful about building this project!

## Learning Clojure

I’ve spent my career as an engineer working with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, but I’ve been getting into [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))s over the last few years, and have been wanting to put them to use on a non-trivial project.

So [Parts](https://parts.ifs.tools) is being built using [Clojure](https://clojure.org), a functional Lisp dialect running on the JVM (and [compiling to JavaScript](https://clojurescript.org/)!). It’s been really fun learning a brand new programming paradigm and a brand new ecosystem, and while it has made progress slower than if I had used tech I’m already familiar with, I feel I am growing as an engineer in the process.

## Parenting

N. is 2.5 years old, and she is an active, smart, happy child. When I re-read [my 9 months of parenting post](/2023/nine-months-of-parenting), I can’t help but smile at my old self, who seems to think he’s got it all figured out. Life with a child keeps changing, and keeps challenging us, the parents, in brand new ways every day. It can be exhausting for sure, but most of all: delightful.
