For the holidays this year, we drove to France, via the Eurotunnel[^1]. We had
planned our trip a few months prior, and booked an early crossing based on N.’s
sleep schedule at that time, hoping to reach our destination in time for her nap
and avoid any sleep pattern disruptions.

As the departure date approached, N.’s sleep pattern eventually _did_ get
disrupted for unrelated reasons, and, as a consequence, so did my partner’s and
mine. An early departure didn’t make sense anymore, and was in fact potentially
dangerous — driving while horribly sleep deprived is not a great idea.

I like to think of myself as a flexible person, but on many occasions, I really
am not. Instead of going for the obvious solution of changing the booking for a
later train, I tried hard to fit a square peg into a round hole. I spent the day
before the departure stressing out about how little sleep we were going to get,
how we might miss the train, how terrible it would be to drive long distance
without a proper morning coffee, &c., until finally, late at night, the
lightbulb lit up above my head.

So: we rebooked the ticket for a later crossing, had a decent night of sleep,
and a smooth drive, with N. taking her nap in the car instead of at the
destination. An obvious move, in retrospect… but something did need to click for
me to be able to break out of the negative mental loops I was stuck in, and to
summon the agency to make a better decision.

I wonder what happened there? I wonder which other areas of my life are affected
by similar negative loops (I suspect the answer is “most of them”), and I wonder
what I could do to further develop this skill of self-awareness. In the
meantime, this post will serve as a record for posterity of this small win.


[^1]: Which… what an incredible feat of human ingenuity! Have you _seen_ this
    thing? You drive your car onto a train, then the train goes under _the
    fucking ocean_, and 30 minutes later you emerge in another country. It blows
    my mind every time I think about it.
