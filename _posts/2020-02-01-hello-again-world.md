This is the gazillionth rebuild of gosha dot net. Welcome! Feel free to skip
to the bottom of the post to see what you can expect from all of this.

I've had my own website in some shape or form since pretty much 1995. My
earliest efforts were hosted on good old Geocities and built around fandom:
[Lois &
Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_%26_Clark%3A_The_New_Adventures_of_Superman),
Star Wars, then Quake. Eventually, as I started to make art myself, the
personal websites I built got more sophisticated, I started blogging, though
intermittently.

I've since unfortunately lost most of the posts I've written, since I kept
changing blogging platforms and hosting providers, and a lot of the content that
existed in, say, Posterous, Tumblr, or a random WordPress install didn't surive
the move to the next platform-du-jour. Then social media platforms took over,
and having your own living, breathing website seemed to become like a thing of
the past.

In the last year or so, I have become much more aware of the issues surrounding
data ownership. [Much has been
written](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
about why platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are not working in the
interest of the artist, researcher, engineer, musician, etc., and taking back
control from those companies begins with taking back ownership of data.

This idea is what fueled the rebuild of this website. I've been using platforms
such as Squarespace, Format, and Cargo until recently to host my [photography
portfolio](/projects/photography), but this iteration of my website has been
essentially _hand-built_, powered by [just a static site generator and a few
open source tools](/colophon).

Before they were called _websites_, a personal web presence was referred to as a
_home page_. There is something deeply satisfying about not only _owning_ one's
(online) home, but also about building it from scratch, with tools of one's
choosing. In the same sense as cooking your own meal will always be more
satisfying than picking a pre-made dish from a menu, so it is for a website. A
sense of mastery has been achieved. Master of my own _domain_, so to say.

This is a welcome feeling in the context of the early 2020s. It also fits nicely
with other trends that I have started to notice in my life recently, trends
towards more awareness, of more discerning selection, and of more intentional
work.

In all of this, I've been inspired by people all around me. Some infinitely
close to me ([my wife](https://www.tingyilai.com)!), some whom I have never met
but interact with daily, online, through [decentralised social
networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)), mailing lists,
and blogs blogs blogs.

With this version of gosha dot net, I'm trying to accomplish just three things:

1. Keep an ongoing documentation of the projects I'm working on, be they
photography, software, or anything else.
2. Give something back. Literally all of my work is built on the shoulders of
people who decided to put their work back in the world, in one form or the
other. I want to be the kind of person who does this.
3. Develop my skills as a writer.

If that sounds interesting, you can subscribe to the blog posts through the
ancient technology known as [RSS](/feed.xml) if you want to be sure to not miss
a thing, or if you'd prefer a couple-of-times-a-year sort of deal, [subscribe
to my newsletter](/newsletter) instead, and get all the good parts straight in
your inbox.

This one is for the long haul; I'm happy to have you here.
