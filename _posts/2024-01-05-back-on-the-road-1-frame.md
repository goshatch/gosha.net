One of my goals for 2024 is to finish the road bike build I have started, and to
start riding again. I have been a few years without a road bike at this point,
and itching to get back on the road.

While my previous builds have been a hodgepodge of components gathered in an
serendipitous way and as often as not replaced on a whim, I want to be
deliberate about selecting components this time, as I hope for this bike to last
me, if not a lifetime, at least a few good decades.

My strategy for component acquisition is this: I research what parts exist,
decide what I need, and then hunt down the best possible bargain, taking the
time I need. The goal is to assemble a high quality collection of parts over
time, while avoiding spending extremely unreasonable amounts of money[^1].
Often, this means going for previous generations of specific parts, as these can
be found at a significant discount.

When building a bike, the fundamental decision is the selection of a frame. In
the past, I rode steel and carbon frames, and loved both the toughness of steel
tubing and the lightness and stiffness of carbon. After flirting with the idea
of going for high-end carbon, I decided to get a titanium frame — almost as
lightweight as carbon, and tough and durable like steel.

[Reilly Cycleworks](https://www.reillycycleworks.com) have been on my radar for
a long while, but their beautiful titanium bikes always felt like something I
would never be able to afford, so I was delighted when my eBay alerts notified
me of a [Reilly
Spectre](https://www.reillycycleworks.com/products/t325-road-disc?variant=40338533875801)
frame available, not only in my size, but also at a very reasonable price.

The Spectre is listed on Reilly’s website as a “gravel frameset”, but the
architecture is very much road-friendly. Reilly’s sales copy reads:

> The all-weather, all-road REILLY SPECTRE tackles both the tarmac and off-road
> trails with speed and comfort.
> 
> With up to 38mm tyre clearance and mudguard mounts, it’s the perfect winter
> bike but come spring, ditch the guards and it’s a full-on, speedy sportive
> machine.  If one of the legendary endurance rides takes your fancy just strap
> on your bags and race off to break the TCR record. The SPECTRE is a titanium
> chameleon and probably the only bike you will ever need.

That all sounds good to me! The versatility that the Spectre promises is
reassuring: I want to be able to do sportive rides, possibly some touring, but
most of all I want to be able to take N. to the nursery, even on the days where
the weather is less than perfect (which, in London, is a large chunk of the year
indeed).

So, with my partner’s support, I hit that “buy it now” button. The frame is now
sitting in its box in our kitchen, waiting for me to gather the rest of the
components, and to build it up.

As I go about doing that, I will document the process in a series of posts here.
In the next episode, we will talk about maybe the nerdiest part of building a
bike: selecting a drivetrain.

See you then!
