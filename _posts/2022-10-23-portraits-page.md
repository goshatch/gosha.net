It’s been a long while since I wrote a blog post! I intend to start writing more regularly and more intentionally, but for now here’s a small announcement:

I’ve added a new page to this website, [Portraits](/portraits). It’s intended as a showcase of my portraiture photography work, and as a business development tool: a quick link I can drop to a potential client.

If you’re interested in having your portrait taken by me, please email me at [us@possible.space](mailto:us@possible.space?subject=Portrait session), and let’s set it up.

I’m looking forward to working with you!
