Our son, E., was born in June; the sweetest, happiest baby I’ve ever seen. We are now parents of two.

I’ve been trying, and failing, to write something meaningful on the occasion of his birth: it’s hard to find the free time, and the focus, to go as deep into this topic as I want.

So I’m putting this up as a placeholder for now: E. was born, he’s healthy, and grows well. It’s all we could ask for. I’m sure I will have much more to say later.
