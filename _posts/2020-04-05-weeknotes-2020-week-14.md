Last year, there was a period of time where I wrote
[Weeknotes](https://weeknot.es/) every week, to summarise the projects I was
working on, books I was reading, etc. I was writing on Medium, and once I had
started my ongoing push for [removing myself from platforms that own my
content](/now), I stopped and deleted my account there.

The weekly writing was a useful practice, though, so here is me trying again, on
my own platform this time (and again inspired by [Tomomi's own
effort](https://www.ripplet.org/weeknotes)).

We're still in the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown here in London, so
there's not much going outside happening. We have a good routine going where
we're waking up early each morning, and getting started with the day.

I'm spending my time between client work, getting my new work environment up and
running (I recently switched to Linux full time -- there will be a blog post
about this), and taking care of the necessities of life.

I turned 38 at the beginning of the week, and we had a small family celebration
over Facetime. It was rather heart-warming to be able to see family, even though
we are all in different countries. We've repeated the experience since with
friends (having dinners and _ap√©ros_ over Facetime), and it's surprisingly
_nice_, and feels really good for mental health in these strange times.

Since we've been spending so much time at home cooking, we've also signed up for
Masterclass, specifically for the Gordon Ramsay teaches Cooking series. We
started watching recently, and I think I have a new nerdy hobby (cooking!).

I've also been talking to some very smart people about tech stuff and learning a
lot recently as well, about the tools that I choose to work with, which will
also result in a blog post down the line.

The client project I've been working on since last year is entering the shipping
phase, which is exciting -- things have been put in production, and _real_
people are interacting with it! The development pace is accelerating, and the
energy that comes with putting something out there for the world is quite
exhilirating. I'm enjoying this.

Until next week!
