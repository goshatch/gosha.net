    <h2>Still in lockdown</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Like many people around the world, we're living in a state of lockdown. I'm keeping busy with work so far, and I usually work from home, so it is not a <em>huge</em> change for me, however I cannot deny that anxiety levels are hightened. Update at the end of December 2020: This is still the case and it's freaking me out a little bit how _well_ we're coping.</p>

    <h2>Building a little project</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In an effort to move away from selling my time towards selling products, I'm trying my hand at building a little commercial product, that derives from a little hobby project I've built earlier this year. I hope to have a very simple first version in the first couple of months of 2021, and will share more then.</p>

    <h2>Back to the Mac</h2>
  </header>
  <p>I got tired of fighting with both software and hardware in the Linux/PC world, so I went back to Apple. I have no regrets: I have learned a great deal about computing and tooling in general when I was using Linux, and a lot of this knowledge has carried over. Meanwhile, every day work and tasks are just much easier and smoother back on a Mac.</p>
  <p>I do miss some things from Linux, such as tiling window managers, and I'm sure my Linux adventures are not over forever, but for now, I'm happy to be productive again.</p>

    <h2>Dreaming of travel</h2>
  </header>
  <p>2020 has seen more than its fair share of cancelled trips, and I've been daydreaming poring over Lonely Planet guides recently. Among destinations I'm most eager to get to: Taiwan, Italy, and Scotland.</p>
