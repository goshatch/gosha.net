    <h2>In lockdown</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Like many people around the world, we're living in a state of lockdown. I'm keeping busy with work so far, and I usually work from home, so it is not a <em>huge</em> change for me, however I cannot deny that anxiety levels are hightened.</p>

    <h2>Studying Ruby and Lisp</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In an effort to get back in programming shape, I'm making time to deepen my studies of Ruby (because I work with it daily) and Lisp (because I can use a variant of it, Emacs Lisp, to basically live inside my text editor)</p>

    <h2>Rethinking my workflows</h2>
  </header>
  <p>I've moved from mac OS to GNU/Linux as my primary operating system a couple of months ago, and I'm now in the process of rebuilding my workflows on this new platform.</p>
  <p>I chose Linux because I wanted to build my work environment around free, open source software, and I'm having a blast figuring out new and powerful new ways to do my work.</p>
