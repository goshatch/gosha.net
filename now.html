    <h2>This website</h2>
  </header>
  <p>I'm rebuilding my long-suffering website, which has spent many years living on various content management platforms (Squarespace, Format, and most recently Cargo). I'm now building it myself, in the spirit of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> movement.</p>
  <p>Many different things combined to bring about this rebuild:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I read a lot about data ownership and wanted to retain control of my online presence;</li>
    <li>I joined a fantastic online community, <a href="https://merveilles.town/@gueorgui">Merveilles</a>, the members of which inspired me with their own web projects and fiercely independent spirit;</li>
    <li>Two designers I respect, <a href="https://www.frankchimero.com/">Frank Chimero</a> and <a href="https://www.destroytoday.com/">Jonnie Hallmann</a>, are both publicly documenting the redesigns of their websites, which inspired me to finally start on this;</li>
    <li>After art school, I'm back in the tech world, and want to use my website not merely as a photography portfolio, but as a place to experiment with ways of expression, which requires control on how the website is actually built.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My initial hope was to finish a rebuild before the end of 2019, but now I see that this will be a much longer iterative process, with possibly no end in sight.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://a.possible.space">creative studio</a> that <a href="https://www.tingyilai.com">Tingyi</a> and I are running is steadily growing and transforming. While it started as a commercial photography venture, it's changing into more of a vehicle for all of our activities, from photography to art psychotherapy workshops to book publishing to software development projects.

    <h2>Rethinking my workflows</h2>
  </header>
  <p>I'm in the middle of rethinking and reworking the processes involved in doing my work. I'm approaching this rethink with attention paid to sustainability, future-proofing, and ownership of data and systems, so it is focusing a lot on free and open source software and systems. This is a long-term project, and something I'm very interested in.</p>
