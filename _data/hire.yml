  - quote: I've worked with Gosha on many projects over the years. Not only is he an excellent developer and expert in his craft, but he's also a true "maker", deeply curious and engaged in every aspect of product development. He brings the same level of attention to both the technical implementation and the user experience. As a designer, that quality makes him easily one of my favorite software developers to work with.

      I worked with Gosha for several months on a complex codebase, where he extended both our frontend (ClojureScript) and backend (Clojure). I really enjoyed his quality-driven approach, ability to independently figure out some pretty complex parts of our codebase, and nicely document his work.

      Gosha is easy-going, friendly and consistently optimistic. Oh, and he's truly multilingual, not only when it comes to programming languages, but also human languages.

  - quote: |
      Over the past five years, I've had the luck of working with Gosha both directly—as part of the same cross-functional team—and indirectly as part of the same larger engineering organisation.

      In every instance, Gosha has been a helpful, collaborative, and fun team player. He brought strong value to both the backend and frontend codebase of our applications.

      Additionally G's background and interest in (web)design was radiant in his thoughtful approach to building and suggesting user-centered solutions, always with accessibility in mind.

      He's a reliable contributor, pleasure to work with as a colleague, and I highly recommend him as a teammate.
