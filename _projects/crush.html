<blockquote>
  “Other men take weeks, months before they fall in love, and even then they love but tepidly, nor can they dispense with endless talk, shared tastes and crystallisations. All I needed was one flutter of her eyelashes. Say I am mad, but believe me. A flutter of lashes, and she looked at me but did not see me, and suddenly I beheld the glory of spring and the sun and the warm sea and the transparency of water near the shore and my youth restored and the world fresh-minted...”

  <p>Since 2017, I’ve been photographing people living through one-sided love stories: crushes, unrequited passion, impossible love.</p>
  <p>Finding people through personals and social media, I asked them to take me to a place related to their relationship, and I photographed them as they reflected on the person in question.</p>
  <p>If you are in this situation yourself, I would love to photograph you. Please <a href="mailto:gueorgui@possible.space">email me</a>!</p>
