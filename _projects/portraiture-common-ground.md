**A note on names:** This text deals with Chinese and Japanese photography,
and thus mentions many Chinese and Japanese names. It is customary to write
names in those cultures with the surname followed by the given name. Thus, in
Luo Yang’s case, Luo is her surname, and Yang is her given name. The same goes
for Nagashima Yurie: Nagashima is the surname and Yurie is the given name.
However, the reverse order, more common in the West, has been preserved in
quotes, citations, and titles of referenced publications.

Morawietz, art historian and director of the popup gallery MO-Industries, for
her help and patience during the research and writing of this dissertation.

## Introduction

In this dissertation, I will examine a certain type of portraiture and the
associated aesthetic, through the lens of two female East Asian photographers.
One, Nagashima Yurie, came to prominence in Japan in the early 1990s, and the
other, Luo Yang, has been building a reputation outside of her native China with
several exhibition in the West since being selected as one of the “rising stars
of Chinese photography” by renowned artist Ai Weiwei in 2012[^1].

I will tentatively call the style these two artists work in the _portraiture of
the common ground_, and, by the conclusion of this text, we will hopefully have
arrived at a definition of this style, within the historical, cultural, and
social context in which it has evolved.

The portraiture style in question has blurred boundaries and is maybe easiest to
talk about in terms of what it is not. It is not formal: the people are often
portrayed in everyday situations and in mundane settings, and the stories told
in the photographs are those of real people inhabiting the real world. It is not
technically elaborate: photographers eschew complex studio lighting setups and
rely on available light or simple on-camera flash to illuminate their pictures.
It is not aggressive: even when the photographs are not candid, the subjects are
rarely felt projecting any kind of hostility, and any strength displayed is
often of the soft and quietly confident kind. However, the _portraiture of the
common ground_ goes beyond the visual style and is related both to the subject
matter itself and the ways to approach it.

The research contained in this dissertation is coloured by my own background and
interests, as well as by my professional practice. I am an immigrant, born in
Russian and having grown up in France, with the notion of common ground
omnipresent in my life and in my work. I am primarily a portrait photographer,
working, and, having spent six years living and practising photography in Japan,
this country and its portrait photographers were the start of the series of
inquiries that led to me exploring this topic. I became familiar Chinese
photography much later, and became so impressed with the work of Chinese
photographers, and with that of Luo Yang specifically, that I have since
travelled to China and have initiated several related photographic projects, the
first of which will be produced in the summer of 2018.

In addition to exploring Luo’s and Nagashima’s work and the parallels between
them, I will attempt to offer a brief overview of the emergence of these
artists, and the social and historic context in which their work has developed
in their native China and Japan.

## Origins of Japan's photographic renewal

In the context of Japanese photography, the aesthetics shared by Nagashima and
her peers are very much a product of their time and of social, economic, and
political upheaval of the 1990s and 2000s.

Japanese photography after the end of the Second World War has a rich history,
marked by three milestones: the renewal of the military alliance with the United
States of America (安保, Anpo) in 1960, the Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964, and the
bursting of the Bubble Economy in 1991.

The intense political confrontation around _Anpo_, which marked the end of
American post-war occupation and set the framework for (among others) the
presence of American military bases in Japan that continues to this day, infused
a new and electrifyingly heightened political consciousness into Japanese
photographers, artists and intellectuals. So strong was this influence that its
echoes continue to be felt this day, not unlike those of the 1968 student
protests in France.

The 1964 Olympic games were followed by a period of high economic growth, in
which photography, as an art, developed significantly. Economic growth meant a
rise in volume for advertising and commercial photography, leading to tackling
of experimental techniques and experimentation on a much wider scale. At the
same time, documentary work blossomed through photographers focusing on the the
newly emerging mass society and its contradiction, as well as through Japanese
photojournalists sent to cover the war in Vietnam, most notably Sawada Kyōichi,
who won the 1965 World Press Photo of the Year award and the Pulitzer Prize for
his picture of a mother escaping a US bombing with her children (Fig. 1). The
photojournalists having paved the way, more and more “Japanese photographers
spent extended periods of time overseas and became active on the international
stage”.[^2]

{% endfigure %}

The emergence of mass society meant that photography became omnipresent:
photographing and being photographed became a part of everyday life, and at the
same time led photographers to join a growing, radical questioning of the
post-war established political, cultural, and economic order. In the late 1960s,
Japan was rocked by waves of student protests, which led to what is could be
considered the peak of Japanese post-war photography, and the decade that
followed is probably what Japanese photography is best known for in the West.

In late 1968, Taki Koji, Nakahira Takuma, Takanashi Yutaka, and Okada Takahiro
established a magazine named _Provoke_, and were joined a year later by Moriyama
Daido.[^3] The aesthetic developed by the _Provoke_ photographers, also known as
_are, bure, boke_ (rough, blurry, out of focus) (see Fig. 2), has endured and
became recognisable world wide, along with the names of the magazine’s founders
— Moriyama, in particular, is arguably the Japanese photographer currently best
known to the Western mainstream.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 2: photograph from Provoke vol. 3, 1969. © Taki Kōji" %}
![Fig. 2: photograph from Provoke vol. 3, 1969. © Taki Kōji](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/02-provoke.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The _Provoke_ aesthetic was born out of the furious anti-American,
anti-establishment protest culture of the Japanese 1960s, and it served the
purpose of the photographers who established the magazine: to bring down
established conventions and to create a new visual language, “to rethink the
rigidified relation between word and image”.[^4]

In the afterword to the first issue, _Provoke_’s Nakahira Takuma writes:

> “How to fill the gap between politics and art? This is both an old and a new
> problem. . . . . My belief is to accept the contradiction between political
> matters and the act of creating something, and try to live with the tension
> between them. This is my personal position, and I would like to operate whilst
> considering the two things separately – to participate actively in the
> political struggle, and to take photographs, in a dualistic way”.[^5]

To understand the context in which the work of Nagashima Yurie and her aesthetic
has emerged, one must look at the political and economical history of post-war
Japan, and what changed from the _Provoke_ era. After the anti-American,
anti-capitalist protests of the 60s and 70s, Japan’s center-right-wing
government has found an innovative way to de-claw the Left, and especially its
more radical wing: by satisfying their demands. The emergence of the practice of
lifetime employment meant that workers were assured of financial stability for
themselves and their families, in exchange for loyalty to the companies
employing them, which in turn became a secondary (and sometimes primary) family
for them. This system helped bring about the Economic Miracle, which saw Japan’s
economy rise to be second only to that of the US. This, however, came to an end
in late 1991 when the asset price bubble burst, triggering an economic decline
that would last over a decade. The public protest culture having been largely
lost thanks to the comforts of a growing economy and lifetime employment,
photographers who came of age during this “Lost Decades” naturally focused more
inward, exploring and finding beauty in a slower, more contemplative life, which
in turn reflects the aesthetic they have developed.

The aesthetic of Nagashima and her peers started to work in in the 1990s stands
in stark contrast to that of the _Provoke_ photographers. It is, in fact, very
much on the opposite side of the spectrum: muted colours as opposed to the
intense, often violent, high contrast black and white, and a focus turned to
private spaces instead of a revolutionary desire to bring down established
conventions and to create a new visual language.

Another defining characteristic of the style that Nagashima works in is the
large part that female photographers played in its development. While in the
_Provoke_ era and subsequent decades Japanese photography was overwhelmingly
male-dominated, many of the defining photographers working in this new aesthetic
are female. Along with Nagashima, Hiromix (see Fig. 3), Ninagawa Mika, Kawauchi
Rinko, Ume Kayo, and many others contributed to the development of this style,
and paved the way to countless more photographers.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 3: From “Girls Blue”, 1996. © Toshikawa Hiromi (Hiromix)" %}
![Fig. 3: From “Girls Blue”, 1996. © Toshikawa Hiromi (Hiromix)](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/03-hiromix.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

It is also not my intention to imply that the work of Japanese female
photographers of the mid-90s is any less radical than that of the men of the
_are, bure, boke_ era: the battleground has moved from the streets to their own
private spaces, and their own bodies within those spaces. The confrontation was
no longer “an ideological clash with the state, but it was a political clash
with the various media that construct female identity”[^6].

For Nagashima and her cohorts, the act of photography “fostered the affirmation
of social and self identities that they were comfortable with, a shield against
the pressures to conform to social and familial expectations.”[^7] “To push
their way through these barriers and face their inner selves for
self-identification, they happened to have the tool of photography”.[^8]

## Nagashima Yurie

{% figure caption: "Fig. 4: ”Expecting-expected”, 2001. © Nagashima Yurie" %}
![Fig. 4: ”Expecting-expected”, 2001. © Nagashima Yurie](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/04-nagashima.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Nagashima was born in 1973 and rose to prominence through a series representing
herself and her family in the nude, winning the prestigious PARCO prize in 1993
while a student at the Musashino Art University[^9].

Just as with Toshikawa Hiromi (also known as Hiromix, another female
photographer figurehead of the 90s), Nagashima’s visual style has initially been
derided as simplistic and amateurish, “in sharp contrast with a type of
photography, popular in the 1980s, in which image-making was considered a
technical craft”[^10]. Dismissively labeled by critic Iizawa Kōtarō as “girly
photography” (女の子写真, onnanoko shashin), the movement spearheaded by
Nagashima is characterised, from a technical point of view, by its welcoming of
imperfection in photographs.

The photographers embraced film stock and cameras considered as amateur and
eschew complex technical processes. They favoured small, compact cameras: easy
to carry around, usually with a built-in flash, strong automation features, and
a moderately wide angle lens, often around 35mm. Asked about the way she
photographs, Kayo Ume (another prominent member of the movement) says: “I always
set my camera at P mode. They say P stands for ‘programme’[^11] but I call it
‘professional mode’.”[^12] The result is often featuring strong colours
(sometimes accentuated even further by direct flash), natural light, and
sometimes chaotic composition. Just like with the _Provoke_ style, an immediacy
and a participation in the moment is privileged over high-level technique or
composition, what photographer John Sypal refers to as being about the “actual
living moment and using the camera to interact with it”.[^13]

In another parallel to the photographers of the _Provoke_ era, then, a rejection
of photography as a highly technical craft is a strong feature of the style
espoused by Nagashima. However, while the _Provoke_ photographers focused on
conflict with the state, Nagashima and the members of her movement turn their
lenses closer to home: close friends, family, and loved ones are frequent
subjects of their photographs. Quoting the famous second-wave feminist rallying
slogan, Nagashima says: “I believe, ‘Personal is political’”[^14]

Nagashima is widely considered to be the photographer whose work launched the
_onnanoko shashin_ movement, and it is that specific style that brought her
stardom at home and, to some degree, recognition abroad. She, however, rejected
term and resented Iizawa for coining it, as it implied a lack of agency and
skills on the part of the photographers: “we didn’t choose snapshot photography
because of a lack of skills, or because we weren’t physically strong enough to
handle larger camera equipment. It was because the portability of those cameras
suited our work, and this explanation made perfect sense”[^15]. When Nagashima
received the Kimura Ihei Award (one of Japan’s highest distinctions for
photographers) in 2000, the prize was given to three photographers together, the
others being Hiromix and Ninagawa Mika. Nagashima felt that the Japanese art
world felt “as if [they] all belonged in that [_onnanoko shashin_]
category”[^16], interpreting the work in a “light, pop-culture sense”[^17] and
ignoring its feminist message.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 5: From the “Kazoku” series, 1993. © Nagashima Yurie" %}
![Fig. 5: From the “Kazoku” series, 1993. © Nagashima Yurie](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/05-nagashima.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

That feminist message is strongly present even in the the debut project that
brought Nagashima recognition in Japan, her nude self-portraits with her family.
Talking at a panel at Art Basel 2018 in Hong Kong, Nagashima explains:

> I felt like I myself was a kind of object, therefore I thought that I had to
> change, I had to express something that was different. My body is my own, it’s
> not the object of the male, that’s what I wanted to express, and that’s why I
> came up with the self-portrait series, which is the nude photos of my family.
> In the 1990s, in the United States at that time there was the Third Wave of
> feminism that started, for example the _Riot Grrrl_ movement, in music, and in
> fashion, through these cultures there was a new feminism, and we get a lot of
> influence by these movements.[^18]

In the same panel, Nagashima Yurie clearly declares: “I am a feminist”.[^19]

The same assertions of agency and individuality permeate the projects Nagashima
has worked on since, in which she continues to explore family, loved ones, and
inner circles. In the monograph _Not six_ (Tokyo: Switch Publishing, 2005), she
shows seven years worth of photographs of her husband, reversing the more
traditional photographer/model gender roles. (Fig. 6). In _Pastime Paradise_
(Tokyo: MADRA publishing, 2000), Nagashima’s record of her life between her rise
to fame and her return to Japan after a few years of studying in the US are
reminiscent of one of her major influences, Nan Goldin, another feminist
photographer. With _5 Comes After 6_ (Tokyo: MATCH and Company, 2014), Nagashima
chronicles her son’s childhood and life as a single mother and a photographer,
following a split with her partner.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 6: From “Not six” series, 2000. © Nagashima Yurie" %}

{% endfigure %}

Moving forward, Nagashima is interested in exploring the stories of women who
gave up dreams in order to take care of families and children.[^20]

## The rise of unofficial photography in China

Luo Yang (b. 1984) is part of a new generation of photographers that is giving
Chinese photography a well-established identity on the global scale. In order to
understand the context in which she produces her work, a brief look in the
history of Chinese photography in the 20th century is necessary.

During Mao’s era, in the upheavals of the Great Leap Forward (1959-1962) and the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) photography was given a purely propagandist
role, serving the state’s goals of generating popular compliance with party
policies.

In one striking photograph taken during the Great Leap Forward famine — which
claimed upwards of thirty million lives — a group of children are depicted
apparently standing on top of a field of wheat, apparently so densely grown that
it could support their weight. (Fig. 7) The children were in fact standing on
top of a bench concealed by the especially arranged stalks.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 7: People standing on top of unharvested grain in the “Sputnik” fields[^21] of autumn 1959.[^22]" %}
![Fig. 7: People standing on top of unharvested grain in the “Sputnik” fields of
autumn 1959.](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/07-sputnik.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Unofficial photography started to emerge into the public view in the the
aftermath of the death of Premier Zhou Enlai in 1976, with amateur photographers
spontaneously documenting the the public mourning for the popular politician on
Tiananmen Square in Beijing, a mourning officially forbidden by the authorities.
Wang Zhiping, Li Xiaobin, Wang Miao, and the other photographers of the _April
5th Movement_ — as the event became known — later became the leaders of the
Photographic New Wave of the 1980s.[^23]

Though the work of these photographers began outside of the system, they
unexpectedly found themselves thrust into the mainstream of Chinese photography:
a compilation of photographs of the _April 5th Movement_ the photographers
published in 1979 under the name of “People’s Mourning” (人民的悼念, rénmín de
dàoniàn) received an unexpected endorsement from China’s top leadership
following the end of the Cultural Revolution and the fall of the Gang of
Four[^24], with the new Party Chairman, Hua Guofeng, authoring a dedication on
the book’s title page, and the editors being invited to join the mainstream
Association of Chinese Photographers.[^25]

Disillusioned with the official hijacking of their project, the _April 5th_
photographers turned away from politics and towards more aesthetic pursuits,
organising several unofficial exhibitions on the theme of _Nature, Society, and
Man_[^26]. While the first of those was held only in Beijing, its success
prompted the following two editions to appear around China, triggering a
nationwide movement known as the Photographic New Wave in 1981. This movement
saw the creation of a large number of photography clubs and publications, a
widespread interest in works of Western photographers and the documentary genre,
and the emergence of photographers such as Mo Yi (fig. 3) and Zhang Hai’er (fig.
4), who responded to the rapid transformation of Chinese cities by developing
“new concepts and languages that allowed them not only to represent an external
reality but also to respond to reality”.[^27]

{% endfigure %}

Towards the end of the 90’s, the New Wave movement has allowed a new kind of
photography to emerge, “that allied itself with the burgeoning avant-garde
art”[^28], which caught the attention of the international art world, with Zhang
Hai’er and others being invited to the Arles festival in France in 1988.
However, this period of growth was cut short by a political event: the violent
suppression by the government of pro-democracy student demonstration in
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 (also known as the _June 4th movement_).
Following the crackdown, avant-garde art was banned and for a few years no
controversial work could be shown.

The new generation of photographers, defining what would come to be known as
_Experimental Photography_ (实验摄影, shìyàn shèyǐng), emerged in the
early-to-mid 90s. They had developed completely outside of the mainstream
institutions — schools, research institutes, galleries — of Chinese photography.
These young photographers were outsiders from the mainstream of Chinese
photography and “constituted a sub-group within the camp of experimental artists
(…) they lived and worked with experimental artists, and showed their work
almost exclusively in unofficial experimental art exhibitions.”[^29]

One of the defining events of this experimental age was the appearance of new
types of experimental art publications, one of the most important ones being
_The Book With a Black Cover_ (黑皮书, hēipí shū) published in 1994 by
experimental artists including Ai Weiwei. The book introduced the new generation
of Chinese experimental artists to the world, with photography being featured as
the most important medium of experimental art.

Conceptual photography developed, relying on theories of postmodernism, which
led Wu Hung comparing the emphasis on concept and display with American
conceptual photography of the 1970s, described by the poet and art historian
Corinne Robins in these words:[^30]

> Photographers concentrated on making up or creating scenes for the camera in
> terms of their own inner vision. To them . . . realism belonged to the earlier
> history of photography and, as seventies artists, they embarked on a different
> kind of aesthetic quest. It was not, however, the romantic symbolism of
> photography of the 1920s and 1930s, with its emphasis on the abstract beauty
> of the object, that had caught their attention, but rather a new kind of
> concentration on narrative drama, on the depiction of time changes in the
> camera’s fictional movement. The photograph, instead of being presented as a
> depiction of reality, was now something created to show us things that were
> felt rather than necessarily seen.[^31]

With Ai Weiwei’s rise to prominence, conceptual and experimental art continued
to develop, leading to the seminal 2000 exhibition _Fuck Off_ (不合作方式, bù
hézuò fāngshì [“Uncooperative Attitude”]) curated by, among others, Ai. In a
conversation with Chin-Chin Yap, Ai Weiwei links the exhibition with the _Book
With a Black Cover_:

> **Chin-Chin Yap:** When you curated _Fuck Off_ in 2000, was there a similar
> concept behind it as with the books?[^32] 
> 
> **Ai Weiwei:** Yes, after these three books we stopped, and a few years later
> there were quite a lot of art events happening and interesting works around,
> so people suggested having a show with a similar sort of attitude as that of
> the books. So we thought about putting on an exhibition. It wasn’t necessarily
> the best show because we had to put it together in a very short time, and the
> conditions were such that the police could shut it down at any moment and
> everything taken away. But the artists were very cooperative and interested
> and the attitude was there. The show’s still being talked about today, because
> it’s an attitude that still matters. So maybe _Fuck Off_ was most important
> because of what it represented. The concept was clear; and we were very clear
> about what we wanted to say towards Chinese institutions as well as Western
> curators and institutions and dealers; their functions are all similar in one
> way or the other. It’s all about the deal, about labour, how to trademark
> different interests. We had to say some thing as individual artists to the
> outside world, and what we said was “fuck off.”[^33]

{% endfigure %}

_Fuck Off_ was shut down by the Shanghai police before the closing date, but the
exhibition went on to acquire a legendary status among China’s younger artists.
It was followed up on in 2013 by _Fuck Off 2_, which Ai co-curated in Groninger
Museum in the city of Groningen in the northern Netherlands. This exhibition was
introduced by the museum as a “show, which includes 37 contemporary Chinese
artists and artist groups, contemplates and questions the current sociological,
environmental, legal, and political climate in China today.”[^34]. The museum’s
blurb goes on: “The exhibition is a sequel to _Fuck Off_, the ground-breaking
show staged in Shanghai in 2000 by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi, which was quickly
censored by the authorities as it was considered too sensitive with its radical
content. Thirteen years later, the lack of artistic freedom in China and the
repressive attitude toward individual actions by the government make _Fuck Off
2_ especially relevant today.”[^35]

Along with other contemporary Chinese artists (some, such as Ren Hang, already
internationally acclaimed), _Fuck Off 2_ introduced international audiences to
the work of Luo Yang. m “Photography 2013 II”. © Ren Hang

## Luo Yang

{% figure caption: "Fig. 12: From “Girls”. © Luo Yang" %}
![Fig. 12: From “Girls”. © Luo Yang](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/12-luo.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Luo Yang was born in 1984 in Shenyang, capital of the northern Chinese province
of Liaoning. She studied graphic design at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts, from
which she graduated in 2009. Luo started photographing in 2007 while in
university, taking pictures of her friends — “the life of those girls who were
around me”.[^36] Out of this process came the project _Girls_, which Luo
developed over the next decade, and which was published as a book by Edition
Lammerhuber and MO-Industries in 2017.

Having been born a few years after the end of the Cultural Revolution, Luo grew
up at a time when China was just starting to open up to Western influences:
“Luo’s generation grew up in a realm of confused cultural constructs, with
strong traces of traditional culture intermingling with new and invasive Western
ideas — all at a pace that was far surpassed by the speed of economic change
swirling around it”.[^37] The effect of this uneasy time are well visible in the
work of Luo’s peers: photographers Ren Hang, Lin Zhipeng, and Chen Zhe (all of
them fellow participants in _Fuck Off 2_) and novelist Chun Shu, whose novel,
_Beijing Doll_ (Riverhead Books, 2004), chronicles growing up in Beijing of the
1990s.

{% figure caption: "Fig. 13: Portrait of novelist Chun Shu, from “Girls”, 2017. © Luo Yang" %}
![Fig. 13: Portrait of novelist Chun Shu, from “Girls”, 2017. © Luo Yang](/assets/images/projects/portraiture-common-ground/13-luo.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In the introduction to the “Girls” book, art historian Eva Morawietz writes:

> The term GIRLS in Luo’s work thus refers to young women who are in the process
> of forming their identity. It denotes a state of mind, rather than a specific
> point in life, although Luo prefers to shoot women who are close to her own
> age. She started the project in 2007 when she was attending university and
> considered herself a ‘young girl’. The series has evolved alongside Luo and
> her life, spanning a timeframe of ten years until today. Her models have grown
> from girls to women and even to young mothers, who joined the series most
> recently. Just like herself, Luo’s GIRLS have often migrated from rural areas
> to the large cities, from Norther China and Liaoning, Luo’s home province to
> Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu or Chongqing. Today, Luo travels all over China to
> photograph women from various backgrounds and ages.[^38]

The time scale and geographical reach of Luo’s work makes _Girls_ a pioneering
project. According to Morawietz: “To date, Luo’s GIRLS series is a first
long-term venture into the portrayal of young Chinese women created by a Chinese
woman, showcasing the plurality of female identity in contemporary China.”[^39]
That is not to say that Luo is the first female Chinese photographer working on
questions of femininity or representing a female point of view. Some notable
precursors are artists Xing Danwen (b. 1967, _Born with the Cultural
Revolution_) and Chen Lingyang (b. 1975, _Twelve Flowers Series_).

The aesthetics of Luo’s work, as well as those of her peers, can be reminiscent
of Western photographers Wolfgang Tilmans or Jürgen Teller. Luo also considers
Rineke Dijkstra, Ana Mendieta, and Nan Goldin as having had influence on her
work, as well as Japanese photographers Moriyama Daido and Nagashima Yurie.[^40]

Like Nagashima’s work, Luo Yang’s photography is done with film, and eschews
technical perfection in favour of a sense of reality and of strong connection
with her models, the eponymous Girls. Even though _Girls_ is a portraiture
project, focusing on both friends and strangers rather than herself, the
connection and the relationship the photographer has with her models brings out
the autobiographical qualities of the work.

The women in _Girls_ belong to the same generation as Luo — with the same
post-Cultural revolution roots — and have grown up together with her over the
ten years the project has been unfolding. Eva Morawietz describes the project as
focused on “the tough process of inner growth in a reality ground in friction,
full of hope and latent crisis”[^41].

In an interview with _Spiegel Online_, Luo mentions that she “always has the
feeling that she’s showing something of herself when (she) portrays other
women”[^42]. She goes on to mention the kind of personalities that attract her
for the project: “Women who are different, who rebel against the rules and who
don't live a standard life, women who have ideals”,[^43][^44] qualities the
photographer — beyond associating them with herself — wants to showcase as the
main point of her project. Morawietz writes:

> “GIRLS are about pure female ego, about showing oneself as a woman, expressing
> individuality and pursuing an independent life based on one’s own choices,
> regardless of traditional expectations, stereotypes or modern-day social
> pressures.[^45][…] the disarming display of the GIRLS’ fragilities becomes a
> powerful marker of unrelenting personal autonomy. Their evident candour
> presents itself as a metaphor for freedom and independence.”[^46]

When asked about the political aspect of her work, Luo and her peers are eager
to insist that their work has “nothing to do with politics directly”[^47], and
that they are focused on the individual. According to Morawietz, Luo’s work is
“very personal, it’s intimate, it’s about individuality, it’s about emotions,
it’s about expressing individuality and authenticity”,[^48] which, in a country
with a history of suppressing the free expression of personal opinions[^49], is
can be seen as an intensely political position in itself.[^50]

In the future, Luo Yang plans to continue working on the project and to develop
it further, to include other media, notably video, and collaborations with other
artists. She is also interested in focusing on the subject of mothers: “When we
were little, in the1980’s, mothers in China went through incredibly hard times,
but nobody ever took note of that. The time of our mothers will pass in a near
future, it would be a pity to not document their lives.”[^51] A hint of this can
already be seen in the work that’s included as part of Girls, including in a
photograph of the twins Wan Ying and Snow Ying (Fig. 14):

> This photo was shot in Chongqing. Chongqing is a very magical city, a city
> with a river of such magnitude, it always fills people with the presence of
> lots of stories. Of the twins, the younger is a mother whereas the elder
> sister is still single. They share the same blood, but have significantly
> different personalities and went in very different directions in life. The
> relationship between these twins is fantastic, loving one another but also
> seeing a different version of oneself in each other.[^52]

## A portraiture of the common ground

The intention at the beginning of writing of this dissertation was to define a
certain visual style common to Luo Yang and Yurie Nagashima, as well as other
artists working with the same sensibilities and on similar subject matter.
However, what has emerged from researching these photographers and examining
their work was beyond mere visuals. The connections between the portraiture work
of Luo and Nagashima are go beyond the aesthetic similarities and get
interesting in the approach to their subject matter exhibited by the two
photographers.

That is not to say that the technical aspect is not important for this
_portraiture of the common ground_. Both Nagashima and Luo are primarily users
of film cameras. Luo says that “there is a humanising impression in film; it’s
rich in both texture and colour. Shooting in film encourages (her) to
contemplate more.”[^53] They both use an array of cameras, in both 35mm and
medium format, and they both produce pictures that are candid and others that
are carefully constructed. Another characteristic of this style is that neither
photographer attempts to construct images beyond what is possible with the model
and the environment at hand. Luo, the more directive of the two, might arrange
her models in ways that she considers more interesting, but says that “usually
the shooting takes place at an environment that they are familiar with, no
preparations or particular settings.”[^54] This lack of artifice (be it in
location, lighting, make-up…) gives the bodies of work produced by the two
photographers a sense of spontaneity, a sense of a realism of the everyday,
which is used in the service of emphasising an intimacy.

Intimacy is a key component of the _portraiture of the common ground_. Both Luo
and Nagashima photograph people close to them. Nagashima photographs her family,
her friends, her husband, her son; Luo her friends and girls with whom she feels
a sense of kinship, and although she has no blood ties to her subjects, one
could imagine them as a sort of extended family she has constructed for herself.
The closeness to the subjects that permeates both photographers’ work allows the
pictures to emphasise a common ground, a humanity shared on several levels.

That humanity is shared first, via mutual vulnerability, between the
photographers and the subjects. Looking at both photographers work, it’s hard
not to be struck by the basic human connection between two people that flows
through the camera. Thus, the act of photographing becomes an act of
acknowledgement and of acceptance from both participants, and, to resort to the
old cliché, each photograph becomes a self-portrait.

Beyond this amalgamation between the photographer and the subject, both
photographers compellingly highlight their subjects’ individuality, and, through
it, their own — quite literally in the case of Nagashima’s self-portraits, and
by implication in the case of Luo’s portrait work. This inexorable insistence on
personal identity has the effect of pulling the viewer, without necessarily
soliciting his or her consent, into the bond of vulnerability, acknowledgement,
and acceptance between the photographer and the subject.

Herein lies the might of the _portraiture of common ground_: the viewer is
forced to extricate the person in the photograph from any kind of grouping that
preconceived notions about gender, age, ethnicity, or appearance might have
placed her in, and to consider her as an individual, with her own hopes,
vulnerabilities, successes, failures, and dreams. In other words, to find a
common ground with her.

When it comes to the subject matter pursued by Nagashima Yurie and Luo Yang —
questions of femininity and the female point of view — this relentless
affirmation of individuality can only be political, clashing as it does with the
established order in countries that have long traditions of patriarchy and
collectivism. The measure to which this feminist attitude is claimed — vocally
by Nagashima and implicitly by Luo — could be seen as a barometer for political
freedoms in their respective countries, however, the fact that it permeates the
work is crucial. The work of Nagashima, Luo, and others working in the same
direction is thus, in an era of increased global trends towards xenophobia and
isolationism, playing a role not unlike that of golden age photojournalism of
the 1950s-70s: promoting a deeply humanist message of peace, acceptance, and a
shared humanity that goes far deeper than any differences possibly could.
