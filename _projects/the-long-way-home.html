title: The Long Way Home
---

<p>Living on the other side of the planet from one’s family means that life is punctuated by long distance air travel, creating two home areas separated by what is in essence a long time spent in a seat, high up in the sky. The vast spaces in between the home areas become a blur: clouds, fields, mountain ranges, and forests, lost in a haze far below.</p>
<p>When the time came to return to Europe after six years spent in Japan, I wanted to stay as close to the planet’s surface as possible. Thus, a twelve-hour journey became one of almost two months.</p>
